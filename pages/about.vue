          <p>Hi my name is Austin Barrett (<a href="https://instagram.com/stripedpurple.io">@stripedpurple</a>) and I am
            a
            longtime fan of Scrubs. Recently I have been on a podcast binge. This
            site is not officially affiliated with the podcast or Iheart Radio, and is completely fan made and maintain.
          </p>
          <p>I made this site purely out of love for Scrubs, Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Joelle Monique, Danl Goodman,
            and
            the podcast, and i don't make any money from its existence. Thanks to all of you for bringing a little
            laughter
            into these all too
            draconian days</p>

          <p>If you have any questions, or want to site anything added to the site feel free to reach out toi me or make
            a
            pull request</p>
